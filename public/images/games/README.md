# Game Images Directory

This directory contains placeholder images for games detected by GamePath AI.
In a production environment, these would be actual game logos or screenshots.

## Default Images
The application expects the following game images:

- valorant.webp - Valorant
- cs2.webp - Counter-Strike 2
- fortnite.webp - Fortnite
- apex.webp - Apex Legends
- lol.webp - League of Legends
- warzone.webp - Call of Duty: Warzone

The application will fallback to placeholder images if these are not present.
